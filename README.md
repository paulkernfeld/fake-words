This is a project that uses simple machine learning techniques to generate fake words in various languages. See [fake_words.ipynb](fake_words.ipynb) for bunch of fake words I generated using this. If you want to use this code as a library, you can call the functions in [fake_words.py](fake_words/fake_words.py).

This project was designed for Python 2.7. In order to use this as a library, you'll need numpy. If you want to be able to execute the notebook as well, you'll need Jupyter and matplotlib.

To reduce file size, dictionaries are downloaded with bower. To download them, run `bower install`.
